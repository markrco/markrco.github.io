			<p style="margin-top:30px;"><h2>One month. 50,000 words.</h2></p>

			<p>According to a quick Google search, one page is only 500 words, 250 words if double-spaced in manuscript format. 50,000/30 = 1,667 words per day—a little over three (or six) pages—depending on the spacing.</p>

			<p>I’ve been excited about NaNoWriMo in the past and have half-heartedly tried it a few times. This year, I’m giving in to the truth: I don’t really want to write a novel. I do want to write but I don’t want to write a novel. I’ve wanted to write blog posts for a while so I’m writing blog posts. 1,667 words might be too long for one post so a day’s writing might end up being multiple posts. I might not write posts end to end; it might be 167 words across ten different topics some days.</p>

			<p>Short blog posts are great. The feeling of “wow, that was information dense and exceptionally high value, especially for the time it took to read”. A couple of minutes to read a handful of key points or even just one. 1,667 words feels like more than most will care to read but <a href="https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b">Medium</a> did the math: the proper length for a blog post is seven minutes—which is about 1,600 words—but the article ends with a note that good writing is more important than length. This rambling is starting to feel like it needs a conclusion and we’re just shy of 250 words.</p>


			<p style="margin-top:30px;"><h2>Tools, Software, Setup</h2></p>

			<p>It’s midnight of day one. I felt the urge to open a dozen tabs of NaNoWriMo tips and tricks: best practices, writing hacks, desk setups, accountability systems, what’s the most minimal text editor to avoid distraction, etc... but I’ve gone that route in the past. I don’t need any new tools or software. I need to make time to sit down and think, dig through my stack of notebooks, and flesh out some of the thoughts I’ve been dumping into Notion as a means of getting them down somewhere so I can focus on whatever I need to be doing in that moment.</p>

			<p>I’m using an Apple Bluetooth keyboard from 2013 (2014?) which might have been the last time I shared writing outside of work. The writing was a customer service complaint letter mailed to 1 Infinite Loop since I wasn’t able to find any other way to complain about the Genius Bar bricking my iPhone. The letter wasn’t overly emotional or angry but it was still cathartic to type out the frustration on a typewriter and mail it off to nowhere. Surprisingly, someone read the letter and I received a response... and this keyboard.</p>

			<p>The keyboard is connected to a recent base model iPad that I bought last year to read papers. Papers that I hoped to distill into blog posts. So here we are.</p>

			<p>I’m writing in Notion because I like it and it looks nice. It’s easy to use, easy to share pages, easy to create lots of pages and hide lots of notes all over the place while pretending that I am organizing my thoughts and building a personal knowledge base. I’ve made a new top-level page for NaNoWriMo and am creating a sub-page for each day. For anyone else using Notion, there’s a word count feature buried at the bottom of the Actions pane within the ⋯ at the top right of each page.</p>

			<p>These posts will be posted on my website which is currently just a landing page. Notion has an HTML export but I’m not sure what that actually looks like yet. The API is <i>coming soon</i>. A worst case “I-really-couldn’t-even-pull-it-together-to-push-some-text-files-to-GitHub” solution could also be to switch on public sharing for these Notion pages. We’ll see how it goes.</p>

			<p><b>tl;dr:</b> I'm making an effort to write and share this month and breaking down mental hurdles by keeping it simple. </p>

			<p>I still have a thousand words to go today and am out of steam here so I’m switching to a different topic. Feel free to reach out if you read this! I’m also trying to spend 10 minutes per day interacting on Twitter so reach out <a href="https://twitter.com/markramina">there</a> or send me an email (mark@).</p>
